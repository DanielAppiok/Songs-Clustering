# Spotify Music Clustering Project

This project applies unsupervised machine learning to segment over **580,000 Spotify tracks (1921â€“2020)** into meaningful clusters based on their audio features. The main goal is to discover natural groupings in music using KMeans clustering and explore characteristics of each cluster.


## Objective

To group songs with similar audio characteristics using unsupervised learning (KMeans), and analyze the resulting music clusters to uncover insights into genre, mood, and style.

---

## Preprocessing Steps

1. Removed unnecessary columns like `id`, `name`, `release_date`, etc.
2. Scaled numeric features using `StandardScaler`.
3. Performed basic EDA to understand feature distributions and ranges.

## Clustering Approach

- **Algorithm Used**: KMeans
- **Optimal K**: Determined using Elbow Method and Silhouette Score
- **Number of Clusters**: 6

## Key Learnings

- KMeans effectively groups songs based on their audio features.
- Certain clusters represent **high-energy dance tracks**, while others contain **acoustic or instrumental-heavy songs**.
- Silhouette Score helped evaluate the compactness and separation of clusters.


## Next Steps

- Add genre tags or mood labels using metadata for deeper analysis.
- Explore other clustering methods (e.g., DBSCAN, GMM) for better separation.
- Build a song recommendation engine based on cluster similarity.
